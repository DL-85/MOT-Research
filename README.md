Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a challenging time series classification task.

It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.

Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data.

## HAR AI Models


* Activity recognition is the problem of predicting the movement of a person, often indoors, based on sensor data, such as an accelerometer in a smartphone.
* Streams of sensor data are often split into subs-sequences called windows, and each window is associated with a broader activity, called a sliding window approach.
* Convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks, and perhaps both together, are best suited to learning features from raw sensor data and predicting the associated movement.

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
run install.bat
```
